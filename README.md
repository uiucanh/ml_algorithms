# ML Algorithms using Numpy

A side project where I write some popular classical ML algorithms 
using just `numpy`.

List of algorithms implemented: 
1. Linear Regression

## Structure
The folder structure is as follows:
```
.
├── models: Contains all the model codes
├── test_models: Contains the scripts to test the models
├── utils: Contains utilities e.g data generation
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

To test out any model, simply run `python test_models/<model_name>.py`
